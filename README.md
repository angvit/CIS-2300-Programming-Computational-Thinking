# CIS-2300-Programming-Computational-Thinking
Computational thinking is a fundamental skill for everyone, irrespective of the discipline, for whom the focus is on solving problems. The goal of this course is to equip students with the basic ability to use computational principles such as abstraction, decomposition, and divide and conquer. The course will introduce students to basic programming constructs (such as control statements) and data structures to facilitate learning of these computational principles.
